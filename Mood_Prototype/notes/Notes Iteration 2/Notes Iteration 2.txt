BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:
 - Remove Shooting Range
 - Re-enable Sound (uncomment functions)
 - Change Version
	> Enable version check savewipe
 - Remove automatic save deletion
 - Remove unlock_all();
 - re-enable fullscreen as default setting
 - remove "unlock all"
 

Notes:
 - reload animation (shells flying)
 - make bullets despawn at the next frame or smth like that (become invisible too soon upon collision)
 - catchtrap holds 1 enemy currently
 - squareholes too far apart bruv
 - no double weapons maybe?
 - instakilling guenther with the pillow doesnt seem right
 - guenther active and downed / sleep sprite have different origin points (?)



Optimization:
 - damage numbers should be created by the enemy upon taking damage, not by the instance causing the damage



Unitended Behavior:
 - You can softlock yourself in pillow fight with throw pillows (because they get consumed)



Bugs:
 - trying to switch weapon crashes the game when there are no / not enough weapons  ## fixed ?
 - "Bursh" minigame broken (I think its the pillow one)								## fixed !
 - Brush minigame hitbox weird (make it larger)										## fixed !
 - ESCaping to menu crashes game#													## fixed ?
 - weapon switching is sometimes buggy												
 - stuff minigame moves with camera lololol											## fixed !
 - stuff minigame BUGGED AGAIN
 - crash: guenther and pablo sabotage env object (something with _broken.applyDamage)
 - you get back more ammo than max
 - despite not having them unlocked, you can choose from all effect weapons from the start
