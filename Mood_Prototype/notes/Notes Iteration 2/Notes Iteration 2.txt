Notes:
 - Demons need to have their physics enabled constantly, so they are properly affected by movement altering	effects such as the black hole gun.



Optimization:
 - damage numbers should be created by the enemy upon taking damage, not by the instance causing the damage



Bugs:
 - Player gets stuck upon trying to exit portal (???)
 - wappons shoot in minigame
