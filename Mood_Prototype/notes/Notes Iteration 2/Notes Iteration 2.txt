BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:
 - Remove Shooting Range
 - Re-enable Sound (uncomment functions)
 - Change Version
	> Enable version check savewipe
 - Remove automatic save deletion
 - Remove unlock_all();
 - re-enable fullscreen as default setting
 

Notes:
 - reload animation (shells flying)
 - make bullets despawn at the next frame or smth like that (become invisible too soon upon collision)
 - catchtrap holds 1 enemy currently



Optimization:
 - damage numbers should be created by the enemy upon taking damage, not by the instance causing the damage



Unitended Behavior:
 - You can softlock yourself with throw pillows (because they get consumed)



Bugs:
 - "Bursh" minigame broken (I think its the pillow one)
 - Brush minigame hitbox weird (make it larger)
 - ESCaping to menu crashes game#
 - weapon switching is sometimes buggy
 
 
 
Completed / Fixed:
 - Demons need to have their physics enabled constantly, so they are properly affected by movement altering	effects such as the black hole gun.
 - wappon shoot in minigame
 - player get stuck upon exiting portal
