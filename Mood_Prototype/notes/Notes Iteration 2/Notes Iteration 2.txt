BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:
 - Remove Shooting Range (or art pass it)
 - Re-enable Sound (uncomment functions)
 - Change Version
	> Enable version check savewipe
 - Remove automatic save deletion
 - Remove unlock_all();
 - re-enable fullscreen as default setting
 - remove "unlock all"
 

Notes:
 - reload animation (shells flying)
 - squareholes too far apart bruv
 - no double weapons maybe?
 - instakilling guenther with the pillow doesnt seem right
 - guenther active and downed / sleep sprite have different origin points (?)
 - cool new sounds from dennis
 - new buttons in settings


Optimization:
 - damage numbers should be created by the enemy upon taking damage, not by the instance causing the damage



Unitended Behavior:
 - You can softlock yourself in pillow fight with throw pillows (because they get consumed)



Bugs:
 - weapon switching is sometimes buggy
 - you get back more ammo than max
 - crash: guenther and pablo sabotage env object (something with _broken.applyDamage)
	>> happens on final damaging?
 - gummybear navmesh crash
 - tickle minigame broken (spawns no feather?) >> lvl 5 or smth
