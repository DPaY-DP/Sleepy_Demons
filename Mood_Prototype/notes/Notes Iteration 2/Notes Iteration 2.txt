BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:
 - Change Version
	> Enable version check savewipe
 - Remove automatic save deletion
 - re-enable fullscreen as default setting
 - remove free reload in obj_loadout
 - remove "unlock levels"
 - remove "unlock weapons"



Optimization:
 - damage numbers should be created by the enemy upon taking damage, not by the instance causing the damage
