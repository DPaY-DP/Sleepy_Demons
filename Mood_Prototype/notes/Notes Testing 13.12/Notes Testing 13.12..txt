Stuff:



Balancing:




De-prioritized:
 - portal gun glitches you or enemies out of map (imprecise exit collision)
 - minigames can still be interacted with and played on level fail
 - cant go back to change ur gun
 - final game time not shown in main menu



Crashes:
 - Crash Marco (finish, lvl: fix my teddy, black hole gun)
