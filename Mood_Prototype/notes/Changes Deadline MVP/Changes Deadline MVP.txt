TO-DO [JOSEPH]

Menu
☑ Schmettings to Settings
☑ Credits usable from menu
☑ Fullscreen solution for different screen resolutions

Gameplay
☑ Remap controls (RMB for punch)
☑ Pillowstuff tunnels
☑ Enemies can be finished inside tunnels

Levels
☑ Import missing levels
☑ gun terminal on wrong layer in level envhp1

Fixes
☑ You can shoot in finish screen
☑ You can shoot in tutorial screen

Bugs
☑ Sometimes trying to execute enemies causes the game to freeze (in fullscreen)
☑ Squarehole minigame sometimes becomes uninteractable
☑ Station doesn't refill weapon as expected (?) 
☑ demons ignore sabotaged tunnels for pathfinding

The "maybe" pile
☑ Repairing an object temporarily disables env damage from that object
☑ balacing pass (juice up weapons)

Polish:
☐ Pause function
☐ Key remapping functionality
☐ auto unequip empty gun
☑ Adaptive level select 
☑ square hole minigame, clicked forms do not need to be unclicked, but get sucked into the correct hole when overlaid
