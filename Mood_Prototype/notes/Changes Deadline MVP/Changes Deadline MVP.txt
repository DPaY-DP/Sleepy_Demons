☐ navmesh bug (after sabotaging tunnel)
			Step Event0 for object OBJ_enemy:
			trying to index a variable which is not an array
			at gml_Script_anon@7661@gml_Object_OBJ_enemy_Create_0 (line 343) - 	var _xNav = navmesh[0].x;
	>> happens when zebediah attempts to instigate pablo in the other room, but ONLY if the hallway down is accessible from the first lobby area. 
	No idea what's going on.
☑ mystery bug: Unable to find instance for object index 100301
				gml_Object_obj_env_Step_0 (line 21) -        if (_member.inSaboPosition) _numberSaboteurs++;
				after executing a yellow demon
		>> Zebediah did not inherit the correct behavior for abandoning his membership during the beginning of a seek state
		>> Hopefully fixed, we'll see

Art Pass
☐ implement sprites into game world
	>> tileset for floors etc
	>> env assets for flavor
☐ implement sounds into game world
☐ Unify font (in minigames for example)


The "maybe" pile
☑ Repairing an object temporarily disables env damage from that object
☑ balacing pass (juice up weapons)

Polish:
☐ weapon draw update
☐ weapon bullet spawn location
☑ Enemy downed stop animation
☐ Enemy downed star animation
☐ Better MC slow down animation
☐ Pause function
☐ Key remapping functionality
☐ auto unequip empty gun
☐ toss empty gun visually
☐ make empty gun unequippable
☑ Fix Pablo pillow wiggle
☑ Adaptive level select 
☑ square hole minigame, clicked forms do not need to be unclicked, but get sucked into the correct hole when overlaid
☐ it would be cool if the starting gun is somewhat limited (reload?)
☐ visual bug with repair gun
☐ juice up repair gun power level
☐ ENV HP bar ?


New shit
- Where is minimap??
- New level crashes regularly (navmesh not assigned, but attempted to read)
