Bugs:
- ERROR03: sometimes enemies can sabotage alone		fixed / reworked
- ERROR05: square hole holes can overlap			unchanged, unable to change with place_meeting ?!
- ERROR04: you can shoot through tunnels			should be fixed



Notes:
- For collision / unstuckment: Give every collider corner / navpoints. If stuck on object for too long, insert closest navpoint into navmesh
	> Raycast from every point to next point. If collider in the way, add navpoints to navmesh.
- Current party system enables unintended behavior where two enemies randomly pick two different env objects and will get stuck on them as they have no
	prioritization for picking the one with an already established party.
- Doors are currently defined by their dimensions, not by which rooms they connect
- 2 doors CAN be implemented without crashes, but one of them gets ignored as the algorithm checks for length of room-chain not length of path 
	(so one is always ignored, as the path through one or the other is the same length of rooms)


- physics based movement for enemies is currently only supported when actively navigating. This needs to be fixes as, for example, enemies 
	take no knockback during recovery.




Added this patch:
 - loss state
 - win state
 - cleaned up loss event
 - minimap
 - env hp bar
 - sleep state for enemies
 - sleep animation
 - crunched enemy code into parent object for ease of use
 - fixed a bug with the square hole minigame (forms and holes will no longer spawn intersecting)
 - removes bug where damage numbers show up on downed enemy
 - removes bullets from room after being used
 - consolidated all bullet projectiles into one parent object
 - re-added flood room functionality
 - added document on how to create levels
 
 - added to state machine code (draw; drawGUI events);
 
	To-DO current iteration:
	- add sprites into rooms
	

Future Implementations:
 - Consolidate all projectiles into parent objects
 - Consolidate projectile functionality into the weapon object for ease of access and understanding
 - add further enemy types
 - re-add floor boosters
