Bugs:
- Enemies can be launched out of map with enough speed
- Punch is ineffective when walking, but highly effective while standing (friction issue?)
		>> issue is the movement and speed calculation where max walkspeed and max allspeed is the same. This results in odd behavior when the player is
			"standing" (no movement input given) but still being moved around by other forces
- Minimap / ENV HP obscuring screen
- slowness doesnt actually slow
- hitscan doesnt pierce as intended
- demons will not re-check if a tunnel they are currently pathfinding to is sabotaged



Notes:
- For collision / unstuckment: Give every collider corner / navpoints. If stuck on object for too long, insert closest navpoint into navmesh
	> Raycast from every point to next point. If collider in the way, add navpoints to navmesh.
- Current party system enables unintended behavior where two enemies randomly pick two different env objects and will get stuck on them as they have no
	prioritization for picking the one with an already established party.
- Doors are currently defined by their dimensions, not by which rooms they connect
- 2 doors CAN be implemented without crashes, but one of them gets ignored as the algorithm checks for length of room-chain not length of path 
	(so one is always ignored, as the path through one or the other is the same length of rooms)


- physics based movement for enemies is currently only supported when actively navigating. This needs to be fixes as, for example, enemies 
	take no knockback during recovery.

	

Future Implementations:
 - Consolidate all projectiles into parent objects
 - Consolidate projectile functionality into the weapon object for ease of access and understanding
 - add further enemy types
 - re-add floor boosters
