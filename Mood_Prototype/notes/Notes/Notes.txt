Bugs:
- ERROR03: sometimes enemies can sabotage alone		fixed / reworked
- ERROR05: square hole holes can overlap			unchanged, unable to change with place_meeting ?!
- ERROR04: you can shoot through tunnels			should be fixed



Notes:
- For collision / unstuckment: Give every collider corner / navpoints. If stuck on object for too long, insert closest navpoint into navmesh
	> Raycast from every point to next point. If collider in the way, add navpoints to navmesh.
- Current party system enables unintended behavior where two enemies randomly pick two different env objects and will get stuck on them as they have no
	prioritization for picking the one with an already established party.
- Doors are currently defined by their dimensions, not by which rooms they connect
- 2 doors CAN be implemented without crashes, but one of them gets ignored as the algorithm checks for length of room-chain not length of path 
	(so one is always ignored, as the path through one or the other is the same length of rooms)


- physics based movement for enemies is currently only supported when actively navigating. This needs to be fixes as, for example, enemies 
	take no knockback during recovery.
