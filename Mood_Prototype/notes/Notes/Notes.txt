Bugs:
- ERROR03: sometimes enemies can sabotage alone		unchanged
- ERROR05: square hole holes can overlap			unchanged, unable to change with place_meeting ?!

Notes:
- For collision / unstuckment: Give every collider corner / navpoints. If stuck on object for too long, insert closest navpoint into navmesh
	> Raycast from every point to next point. If collider in the way, add navpoints to navmesh.
